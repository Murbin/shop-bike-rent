I use redux-react because let me add in one place all states. It is more easy beacause the developer can find very fast any state. Redux is focus or used in complex applications. The curve of learn i hard , but Its a powerfull tool to manage your applications.

it have the pattern factory because it let us refactor and reuse a component that it has already created, so it avoid innecesary code.

Redux has a method to invoce or fetch external api without impact in the performance, it is in the store to with the states, but separated correctly.

I dont use localstorage because its a bad practice, Its better manage all the state in redux, even sessions, or tokens users.

Allways the parts most dificult is the config en redux or the images sizes, so it was a little more complicated to me, than the others functionalities.

The project used prettier extension to clean the code. Its more readable.

The project use react-router because it offers us a many way to manage the routes more easily and it has a big community, so there are a lot documentation.

The project used hook instead class components because . it offers useEffect and other tools to increase the performance of the site. For example with use effect. It dont need use de lifecicles components, that have innecesary code.

The project used Formik beacause offers us methods or callbacks to manage the value or the errors or the submit data more readable for us.

It used styled-components beacause with thease we an create components with css , where we can use variables and media queries, all in the same place. I dont keep the all css code in all files becouse the time, but i used style component in a few to show you Hot I used it
